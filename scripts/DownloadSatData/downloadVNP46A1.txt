#nH disables host-prexied directories...  By default, invoking Wget with ‘-r http://fly.srk.fer.hr/’ will create a structure of directories beginning with fly.srk.fer.hr/. This option disables such behavior.
#-c Your download can get interrupted if you lose the internet connection or experience a power outage
#-b for download in background. A wget-log will appear in your working directory, which can be used to check your download progress and status
#-P saves files in specified directory
#-e Execute command as if it were a part of .wgetrc (see Startup File). A command thus invoked will be executed after the commands in .wgetrc, thus taking precedence over them. If you need to specify more than one wgetrc command, use multiple instances of ‘-e’. 
#robot=off DONT TOUCH is to avoid wandering the website and bothering the admins with stolen resources
#-np no parent Do not ever ascend to the parent directory when retrieving recursively. This is a useful option, since it guarantees that only the files below a certain hierarchy will be downloaded.
#-m to keep a mirror of a page (or FTP subdirectories) COULD REMOVE..
#-r Turn on recursive retrieving.
#-R rejlist, --reject rejlist
#--cut-dirs Ignore number directory components. This option is useful for getting a fine-grained control over the directory where recursive retrieval will be saved.
